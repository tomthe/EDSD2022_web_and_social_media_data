            Vladimir Putin today chaired a 'bonkers' meeting of Russia's top security chiefs, during which they stood up one-by-one and laid out the case for sending troops into Ukraine. In a televised spectacle, Russia's top security officials claimed that ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine are under threat of 'genocide', that no peace deal can protect them, and that Putin should recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as independent and come to their defence. But in evidence that the entire spectacle is being staged for the benefit of the Russian public - amid western warnings that the decision to invade has already been made - eagle-eyed viewers noticed that defence minister Sergei Shoigu's watch was five hours behind Moscow time, suggesting the hearing was pre-recorded. Kiev strongly denies carrying out any artillery attacks or 'sabotage' missions, accusing separatists of faking the blasts - including using limbs collected from morgues to pose as 'victims' - and peddling 'fake news' as a pretext for Russia to attack under the guise of 'protecting' the breakaway regions.

She reported the attack to the Qatari authorities, which responded by accusing her of having an affair and charged her with 'extramarital sex', which is illegal in the Gulf State. Schietekat was told by lawyers that one way of avoiding conviction was to marry her attacker but instead decided to flee the country, leaving behind what she called her 'dream job'. The charges against Schietekat, who is an economist and anthropologist, are still valid and she is expected to be sentenced in absentia on March 6. Qatar has been embroiled in scandals as the World Cup approaches, with reports of thousands of migrant workers dying in the country since it was awarded the tournament in 2010 and stinging criticism of the government's human rights record.

            Rising flood waters began to breach defences along the River Severn today as residents were forced to flee their homes - before other parts of Britain face further 70mph winds, heavy rain and up to a foot of snow tomorrow. The stormy weather hitting the UK shows no signs of ending, with more than 11,000 homes still without power and rail lines remaining blocked - and riverside and coastal communities around the country still on flood alert. Storm Franklin, which was the third storm in five days and caused widespread chaos with 87mph winds, prompted a warning for residents living along the Severn to be prepared for significant flooding today and tomorrow. Danger to life warnings were in place along the Severn at Ironbridge in Shropshire and Bewdley in Worcestershire, with aerial photographs taken at the latter showing how defences were beginning to be 'overtopped' by the water. Meanwhile rail disruption continued to affect commuters today, with Transport for Wales saying no services could run between Shrewsbury and Birmingham, Cardiff and Aberystwyth in West Wales due to flooding on the line. West Midlands Trains faced the same problem between Shrewsbury to Wellington, while trains in South Yorkshire were again disrupted by flooding at Rotherham which saw all Northern services through the station cancelled. Pictured today: Flood barriers at Bewdley in Worcestershire (left) and Ironbridge in Shropshire (top right), and a submerged car in York (bottom right).

            Boris Rotenberg, co-owner of SMP Bank, and his nephew Igor Rotenberg, have had their assets frozen following Putin's decision to send troops across the border last night, along with Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire who controls the Volga Group. Five Russian banks will also be barred from trading in the Uk as the West seeks to hit back economically, Boris Johnson told MPs. However the sanctions regime was criticised after it emerged that the trio have been subject to sanctions in the United States for years, while freely able to make money in the UK. Bill Browder, the financier and arch Putin critic, tweeted: 'Pretty tepid if you ask me. The oligarchs have been on the US sanctions list since 2018.'

Lady Rosamond (bottom left) had left her estate to her two children in equal shares, including the £2million Leigh Hill House (bottom right), which she had received in divorce from the earl in 2009. But the High Court heard that ten years after her death, the viscount - who was named administrator of their mother's estate - has still not sold the house and shared the inheritance with his sister. With their father David Budenell-Bruce (top right), watching on from the back of the High Court, Deputy Master John Linwood described the spat as 'an unfortunate case of sibling distrust' and said the 'breakdown in relations' meant removing the viscount from his role as executor was necessary. The Voice UK star (top left) will now be able to receive her split of her late mother's inheritance almost a decade after her death.

            A British homeowner was astonished to find an incredible Second World War mural hidden behind old wallpaper. Natalie Mansfield, 30, was renovating a study at her home in Bispham, Blackpool when she came across the hand-painted image. The 8ft x 6ft mural depicts two types of fighter planes buzzing around an aircraft carrier. It also shows dive bombers arcing down towards the water and dropping bombs on suspected enemy targets, while munitions explode in the sea below them. Miss Mansfield has claimed that the image could date back to 1935, several years before the outbreak of the world war but during a period of mounting tension in Europe amid German aggression. But historians dispute this and believe that it could portray military action in the Mediterranean during the global conflict, pointing to the clear weather and markings on the German dive bomber.

       Pictures show the hostage cuffed with his hands behind his back sat opposite his captor who appears to be pointing a gun in his direction. A clip earlier showed the captive in a headlock with a gun pointed at his head inside the shop. The hostage-taker could be seen waving around the weapon as he gestured towards customers sat in a restaurant across the street. Dutch media had earlier today reported the hostage was British but police later confirmed he was a 44-year-old man from Bulgaria. The hostage managed to escape the ordeal by fleeing the gunman who then chased him down the street before suddenly being hit by a police car in Leidseplein - a square in the centre of the Dutch capital. Police said the incident, which started around 5:40pm, lasted nearly five hours and involved dozens of hostages. 'Dozens' of hostages left the building aby 9:15pm and officers declared the incident over around 10pm. Amsterdam police said: 'We managed to stop the hostage-taker by hitting him as he ran out. Violent images of that collision can be seen. We now know that the suspect had no explosives on his body and medical personnel are now taking care of him.'

            Daily Stuff have come up with a list of times when hilarious (and usually understandable) notes have been left for people all over the world when they couldn't tell them what they thought face-to-face. Sometimes, your day can be totally ruined by someone being selfish or just not thinking about their surroundings and others. Usually, the best way to solve any dilemmas or cases of confusion is to talk it out and find the best solution to suit both parties. It can be a situation with strangers, neighbours, loved ones or enemies - but on some occasions, they aren't there to face the music when they have done something that has inconvenienced you. Imagine you're in a car park, and the only space left is one next to a small vehicle plonked over two slots, leaving you with no option but to go miles elsewhere. One man was so annoyed about a car sitting right over the the line of two spaces that he drew around it with chalk and wrote below, 'Parking spot just for you' (top left). Or you're at work and your colleagues sitting beside you spoil a great TV show by constantly discussing it, yet you don't want to keep reminding them to keep quiet the day after the latest episode. Bottom left, a cut out sign to tell someone to do the dishes, and right, a note left for a waiter who didn't give one man any attention other than his wife when at a restaurant.

He said that he reckoned tiger sharks were responsible, although he couldn't be sure, and that he has had similar experiences in recent years with sharks tailing his fishing boat looking for an easy source of food. There has been an increase in shark attacks in recent years with one theory stating that sharks are more active in warmer. Scientists from the UK in a 2018 study found a water temperature of 22C was preferred by tiger sharks.

            The inspiration behind the iconic Columbia Pictures 'Torch Lady' logo began in the makeshift New Orleans studio apartment of local photographer Kathy Anderson in 1991. The snapper was asked by her artist friend Michael Deas to shoot a reference photo for a painting that 'could potentially be used as the new logo' for the legendary film studio. 'I had no idea how iconic the image would become,' she told DailyMail.com. Anderson asked her work colleague to model for the test shoot over her lunch break. Using bedsheets and a lamp that resembled a torch, Anderson created a series of photos that would eventually become the basis for Deas' painting and the ubiquitous logo. The photographer has since gone on to win a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage Hurricane Katrina.

            A British homeowner was astonished to find an incredible Second World War mural hidden behind old wallpaper. Natalie Mansfield, 30, was renovating a study at her home in Bispham, Blackpool when she came across the hand-painted image. The 8ft x 6ft mural depicts two types of fighter planes buzzing around an aircraft carrier. It also shows dive bombers arcing down towards the water and dropping bombs on suspected enemy targets, while munitions explode in the sea below them. Miss Mansfield has claimed that the image could date back to 1935, several years before the outbreak of the world war but during a period of mounting tension in Europe amid German aggression. But historians dispute this and believe that it could portray military action in the Mediterranean during the global conflict, pointing to the clear weather and markings on the German dive bomber.

Sometimes, your day can be totally ruined by someone being selfish or just not thinking about their surroundings and others. Usually, the best way to solve any dilemmas or cases of confusion is to talk it out and find the best solution to suit both parties. It can be a situation with strangers, neighbours, loved ones or enemies - but on some occasions, they aren't there to face the music when they have done something that has inconvenienced you. Imagine you're in a car park, and the only space left is one next to a small vehicle plonked over two slots, leaving you with no option but to go miles elsewhere. One man was so annoyed about a car sitting right over the the line of two spaces that he drew around it with chalk and wrote below, 'Parking spot just for you' (top left). Or you're at work and your colleagues sitting beside you spoil a great TV show by constantly discussing it, yet you don't want to keep reminding them to keep quiet the day after the latest episode. Bottom left, a cut out sign to tell someone to do the dishes, and right, a note left for a waiter who didn't give one man any attention other than his wife when at a restaurant.

In its 16th edition, the Shed of the Year contest, run by garden products company Cuprinol, invites entrants to submit their creations in one of seven categories for the chance to win a prize of £1,000 and £100 worth of Cuprinol products. Entries this year include The Winchester Tavern (pictured top left), which would not look out of place in Lord Of The Rings - bar its widescreen TV - and The Dog House (pictured bottom left), a pup-friendly pub which is deceptively small-looking on the outside, but houses a fully stocked bar in its interior, complete with seating areas and a virtual dart board. There is also a Victorian railway carriage turned into a workshop (pictured top right), a Tardis working as a tool shed (pictured bottom right) and a triangle-shaped shed being used as an artist's workshop (pictured bottom centre)

            The inspiration behind the iconic Columbia Pictures 'Torch Lady' logo began in the makeshift New Orleans studio apartment of local photographer Kathy Anderson in 1991. The snapper was asked by her artist friend Michael Deas to shoot a reference photo for a painting that 'could potentially be used as the new logo' for the legendary film studio. 'I had no idea how iconic the image would become,' she told DailyMail.com. Anderson asked her work colleague to model for the test shoot over her lunch break. Using bedsheets and a lamp that resembled a torch, Anderson created a series of photos that would eventually become the basis for Deas' painting and the ubiquitous logo. The photographer has since gone on to win a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage Hurricane Katrina.

            A British homeowner was astonished to find an incredible Second World War mural hidden behind old wallpaper. Natalie Mansfield, 30, was renovating a study at her home in Bispham, Blackpool when she came across the hand-painted image. The 8ft x 6ft mural depicts two types of fighter planes buzzing around an aircraft carrier. It also shows dive bombers arcing down towards the water and dropping bombs on suspected enemy targets, while munitions explode in the sea below them. Miss Mansfield has claimed that the image could date back to 1935, several years before the outbreak of the world war but during a period of mounting tension in Europe amid German aggression. But historians dispute this and believe that it could portray military action in the Mediterranean during the global conflict, pointing to the clear weather and markings on the German dive bomber.

Sometimes, your day can be totally ruined by someone being selfish or just not thinking about their surroundings and others. Usually, the best way to solve any dilemmas or cases of confusion is to talk it out and find the best solution to suit both parties. It can be a situation with strangers, neighbours, loved ones or enemies - but on some occasions, they aren't there to face the music when they have done something that has inconvenienced you. Imagine you're in a car park, and the only space left is one next to a small vehicle plonked over two slots, leaving you with no option but to go miles elsewhere. One man was so annoyed about a car sitting right over the the line of two spaces that he drew around it with chalk and wrote below, 'Parking spot just for you' (top left). Or you're at work and your colleagues sitting beside you spoil a great TV show by constantly discussing it, yet you don't want to keep reminding them to keep quiet the day after the latest episode. Bottom left, a cut out sign to tell someone to do the dishes, and right, a note left for a waiter who didn't give one man any attention other than his wife when at a restaurant.

            The inspiration behind the iconic Columbia Pictures 'Torch Lady' logo began in the makeshift New Orleans studio apartment of local photographer Kathy Anderson in 1991. The snapper was asked by her artist friend Michael Deas to shoot a reference photo for a painting that 'could potentially be used as the new logo' for the legendary film studio. 'I had no idea how iconic the image would become,' she told DailyMail.com. Anderson asked her work colleague to model for the test shoot over her lunch break. Using bedsheets and a lamp that resembled a torch, Anderson created a series of photos that would eventually become the basis for Deas' painting and the ubiquitous logo. The photographer has since gone on to win a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage Hurricane Katrina.

       Vladimir Putin gave a sinister warning to Ukraine's allies in the West as he declared war during his early Thursday morning address from Moscow. Explosions were heard in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, as Putin announced that Russia was launching a military attack on Ukraine. 'To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside - if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,' he said on a television broadcast around 6am Moscow time (3am UK time). The United Nations Security Council had just convened an emergency meeting Wednesday night. Earlier Wednesday, European and U.S. officials rushed to place more economic sanctions on Russia in response to its deployments of troops to eastern Ukraine. Amid escalating aggressions from Russia, the Ukraine also warned its citizens warned its citizens to avoid traveling to Russia and leave immediately if they were there already.

       General Sir Richard Shirreff (left with David Cameron in Iraq), ex-deputy supreme commander of Nato, has said Britain's first line of defence is now the border of former Soviet states who fear they could be next after the invasion of Ukraine (right). He said: 'There is a possibility that we as a nation will soon be at war with Russia. We in this country must recognise that our security starts not in the white cliffs of Dover - it starts in the forests of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.' Sir Richard has said today's invasion must change Boris Johnson's 'mindset' - warning that he believes Putin (inset today) is bent on restoring the USSR, which was split into 15 republics when it imploded in 1991. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he was asked by Nick Robinson if Britons and their 'children and grandchildren' may be 'expected to fight' the Russians, and Sir Richard replied: 'Absolutely. If Russia puts one bootstep into Nato territory, we are all at war with Russia'. He added: 'It is very possible he might move into Nato countries and lead to war with thirty countries'. But he warned that Britain or Nato cannot deploy in Ukraine 'because that will precipitate a third world war'.

            DAN WOOTTON: Not only has the insane megalomaniac Putin declared war on Ukraine and launched an invasion of a sovereign country in Europe by a major power for the first time in 80 years, he has also threatened the world with nuclear war. With depressing predictability, appeasing Putin failed spectacularly - and Europe and the world is now in great peril. God help us that the leaders of the west and the east, who hold our very future in their shaky hands, are both senile old men. There's the likely dementia-plagued US President Sleepy Joe Biden, who, at 79, barely managed to stutter and stumble his way through a scripted address about the crisis two nights ago. Then there's the war criminal Putin himself who is a decade younger than Biden but has been described by the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny as a 'senile drunk grandfather', which could even be funny if he wasn't in charge of the nuclear codes and threatening to use them. Channelling his inner Churchill and showing he is the right Prime Minister for this moment in history, Boris has called this crisis correctly from the start.

'Is it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine? Sure, it's a possibility,' Blinken told host David Muir. But he stressed that progressing beyond Ukraine into neighboring Poland, Slovakia, Hungary or Romania would mean invading a NATO member country, and would automatically draw in the US, UK, France, Canada and the other nations that form the 30-country alliance. 'There is something very powerful standing in the way of that, and it's something we call Article Five,' said Blinken.

            Ukrainian forces were pictured taking up defensive positions across key streets in Kyiv as they prepared to  to battle Russian troops for control of the capital of three million people even as air raid sirens wailed over the city. A senior official troops were defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered after residents scrambled to take cover in basements, metro stations and bomb shelters across the capital following a televised warning of air strikes. Meanwhile residents were pictured surveying the damage to their home, near Kyiv's main airport, after the 10-storey apartment block's windows were blasted out a two-metre crater filled with rubble forming, showing where the shell had struck before dawn. Corpses of two Russian servicemen who had dressed in military fatigues in an apparent bid to sneak into the Ukrainian capital were pictured strewn next to an unmarked armoured vehicle after they were killed in a skirmish with Kyiv's forces early this morning. Ukrainian officials said a Russian aircraft had been shot down and crashed into a building in Kyiv overnight, setting it ablaze and injuring eight people. The Kyiv city council warned residents of the city's Obolon district, near Gostomel, to stay indoors because of 'the approach of active hostilities' after gunfire was heard in the suburb, as well as the districts of Vorzel, Bucha and Irpen, this morning as Putin's men advanced from Chernobyl, less than 60 miles outside the capital.

       Intense fighting has broken out on the streets of Ukraine, with saboteurs gunned down on and a soldier blowing himself up to slow down the advancing Russians. The desperate resistance is slowing down Vladimir Putin's forces, a US security official said, due to the bravery of those fighting at close range against the troops in bloody combat. Stunning feats of resistance include a heroic marine (inset) who blew himself up along with a bridge (top right) in Crimea to hold off the Russians and allow his battalion to regroup and redeploy. A deadly skirmish (bottom right) also broke out on the streets of a Kyiv suburb today between Ukrainian forces and alleged Russian saboteurs. The clash saw at least two people shot dead in a car park in front of a large apartment block in Obolon, found north of Kyiv.

       Intense fighting has broken out on the streets of Ukraine, with saboteurs gunned down on and a soldier blowing himself up to slow down the advancing Russians. The desperate resistance is slowing down Vladimir Putin's forces, a US security official said, due to the bravery of those fighting at close range against the troops in bloody combat. Stunning feats of resistance include a heroic marine (inset) who blew himself up along with a bridge (top right) in Crimea to hold off the Russians and allow his battalion to regroup and redeploy. A deadly skirmish (bottom right) also broke out on the streets of a Kyiv suburb today between Ukrainian forces and alleged Russian saboteurs. The clash saw at least two people shot dead in a car park in front of a large apartment block in Obolon, found north of Kyiv.

Her baby was due as she hid protected from the onslaught in a shelter in the city as gunfire raged outside.

With both teams warming up prior to kick-off,  Zinchenko and Mykolenko headed over to another to embrace and appeared to share a few words of comfort. Both players were named among the substitutes for their respective clubs, and they re-emerged from the tunnel a few minutes before kick-off to take their places on the bench. Zinchenko was clearly appreciative of the support from both sets of supporters as he applauded the home fans on his way across the pitch.

            Hollymount Primary School (top right) in Raynes Park, South London, hosted the burlesque entertainer Dolly Trolley (pictured left, inset and bottom right) during its 'This Is Me' day last Tuesday as part of a week-long celebration of diversity. Wearing knee-high leather boots and a low-cut sequined dress, Dolly Trolley taught a dance to pupils aged nine and over before reading to pupils aged five to nine. Parents voiced their anger after learning of the drag queen's visit when their children returned from school, with some taking to the popular online forum Mumsnet to express their concerns. One mother, with a son and daughter at Hollymount, told The Mail on Sunday: 'We are usually told when an outsider will be visiting the school, but on this occasion we were not. My daughter said she felt weird and didn't like it. She said a lot of the teachers were pulling funny faces when Dolly came out in a very revealing short beaded dress and thigh-high black leather boots. After the show, Dolly went around to the other year groups and read stories.

            EXCLUSIVE: The Russian-speaking woman whose bloodied face became the iconic image of the sickening war in Ukraine has blamed Vladimir Putin for the carnage. Brave Olena Kurilo (right, and inset), 52, was pictured outside her blitzed home (also, left) in an image which summed up the horror of a conflict in which thousands have now died. She was almost one of them, when the Russians struck at a military base near her home in Chuhuev, Ukraine - and blitzkrieged her block. In an exclusive interview, she told how she still has glass embedded in her skin and eyes, and fears for her sight because there is no medical help available. But the half-Russian mother-of-one, a kindergarten teacher, tells how she was almost killed - and pleads with Putin to stop the war, and take his troops home. Two years ago, Olena nearly died when a military plane came down a stone's throw from her flat, killing 26. She said: 'After Putin made his statement recognising LPR [Luhansk People's Republic] and DPR [Donetsk People's Republic], we carefully watched the situation. We thought that some common sense was still there to negotiate. We never thought there would be a war.'

Hundreds of people, including Ukrainian former journalist Victor Kovalenko, took to Twitter to share a translation of the humorous exchange. Fighting has raged on in and around major Ukrainian cities for a third consecutive day, as Kyiv's defence ministry has so far put Russia's losses at around 2,800 troops, 80 tanks, 516 armoured vehicles, and 10 airplanes and seven helicopters. Intelligence experts have predicted Vladimir Putin's £15bn-a-day war with Ukraine is no longer going to plan due to Kremlin 'overconfidence', poor tactical planning, and 'shock' at the fierce resistance put up by brave Ukrainians fighting for national survival.

Camilla's (left) family tree connects her with at least seven dukes, six marquesses, 15 earls, seven viscounts and eight barons. An alarmingly large number of Camilla's ancestors died a violent death. Lord Darnley (bottom left) - married to Mary Queen of Scots and himself a contender for the English throne - was murdered, aged only 20, in February 1567. A much discussed kind of notoriety is attached to the writer and philosopher the Marquis de Sade (top right), Camilla's relative through a 17th Century forebear, Sebastien, Baron de Ploeuc. Somewhat improbably, Karl Marx (bottom right) and Camilla are related through a 17th Century Scottish aristocrat and politician, Sir Robert Campbell of Glenorchy.

Sources suggest that the possible involvement of Affleck in a forthcoming Barbie movie, which is being made at Warner Bros' Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire, may explain their interest in a British bolthole. There has been speculation that the Good Will Hunting star is in talks with producers on the film who have already cast Margot Robbie (right) as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as boyfriend Ken. Affleck and Lopez, who rekindled their relationship last May, have instructed property agents to find a place for them to rent, probably in South-West London.

Anna Semyuk, 33, from Kamianets-Podilskyi in western Ukraine, hugged her son (right) again after her husband had let a stranger take their children over the border and keep them safe as they fled the Russian invasion. Their father couldn't take them since Ukraine has banned men aged 18 to 60 from leaving in a bid to guarantee the country's 'defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation'. Waiting at the border crossing on the Ukrainian side, Anna's 38-year-old husband had put his trust in Nataliya Ableyeva, 58, who ferried the children over the Hungarian border. They made up a few of the thousands who made border crossings out of Ukraine today, on their way to Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Romania. In Poland alone, 9,000 refugees desperate to leave Ukraine passed by the border today, many of them tearful when they made it. Yet as many as four million Ukrainians could move out of the country as refugees because of the Russian invasion, a UN official admitted.

The Ukrainian premier had called for Europeans with 'combat experience' to help in his country's bitter struggle against despot Vladimir Putin's forces. Among those responding at the Medyka border crossing was Jedrzej Bien, 42, from Braniewo, northern Poland, who made a 16 hour journey and was in a queue waiting to cross into Ukraine. Dressed in army fatigues he had picked up from an army surplus store, he said: 'I feel I have a sense of duty. I heard Zelensky asking for European help and now here I am. The Ukrainian people need us now to fight off the Russian aggression - history provides a valuable lesson to us and we must not let 1939 happen again.'

            Hollymount Primary School (top right) in Raynes Park, South London, hosted the burlesque entertainer Dolly Trolley (pictured left, inset and bottom right) during its 'This Is Me' day last Tuesday as part of a week-long celebration of diversity. Wearing knee-high leather boots and a low-cut sequined dress, Dolly Trolley taught a dance to pupils aged nine and over before reading to pupils aged five to nine. Parents voiced their anger after learning of the drag queen's visit when their children returned from school, with some taking to the popular online forum Mumsnet to express their concerns. One mother, with a son and daughter at Hollymount, told The Mail on Sunday: 'We are usually told when an outsider will be visiting the school, but on this occasion we were not. My daughter said she felt weird and didn't like it. She said a lot of the teachers were pulling funny faces when Dolly came out in a very revealing short beaded dress and thigh-high black leather boots. After the show, Dolly went around to the other year groups and read stories. We've spoken to both our children and they both said their friends all thought it was weird and inappropriate for their age.' A poll on Mumsnet found that 87 per cent of almost 3,000 respondents regarded the drag queen's appearance at a primary school as 'inappropriate'.

Those enjoying the 90-minute trip in the zebra-striped bus (bottom left inset) included Hollywood stars Leonardo DiCaprio (left), insulated from the wintry cold by a navy puffer jacket and baseball cap, and Orlando Bloom (bottom middle inset), in scruffy jogging pants, baggy jumper and beanie hat.

            Vladimir Putin reportedly only had contact with his inner circle during the pandemic, but even they were asked to present faecal samples several times a week to check for infection and, in some cases, asked to isolate for two weeks before face-to-face meeting. It is the latest in a string of questions being asked about the Russian leader's state of mind after he announced the invasion of Ukraine in 'rambling, terrifying, apocalyptic' fashion. Rumours surrounding the Russian leader's health have been swirling for years, with repeated reports suggesting that he is suffering from cancer and Parkinson's disease, or been affected by long Covid-19 causing 'brain fog'. Fears were raised again yesterday after US Senator Marco Rubio appeared to suggest he believes Putin is mentally unwell in a tweet that warned it was 'pretty obvious' that 'something is off' with the Russian president amid his invasion of Ukraine. 'I wish I could share more, but for now I can say it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin', the Republican Senator for Florida wrote.

Mother-of-one Lesia Polataiko, 58, (right, in pink scarf, with Tatiana Maydanyuk, 47, from Woking, Surrey, who was also heading to Lviv to see her doctor son Paulo, 24) moved to Britain in 1996 and now has UK citizenship but her mother Halyna still lives in the western city of Lviv. She is desperate to get her to safety but strict visa regulations mean she is not allowed to travel as only UK dependents are being granted vital paperwork to get into the country. MailOnline found Lesia waiting on the platform at Przemysl station, clutching her British passport waiting patiently with dozens of others for a train across the border into Ukraine. Officials say around 156,000 refugees (left) have fled into Poland from the Ukraine with Saturday being the busiest day with more than 77,000 coming into the country through nine official crossing points.

            Somehow, with the fate of his country's 44 million citizens on his shoulders, President Zelensky sounded and appeared carefree. 'Listen, I am here,' he said reassuringly. 'We will not lay down our weapons. We will defend our state. This is our land, our country, our children. And we will defend all of that.' Hours earlier he had declined the offer to flee the besieged city from US President Joe Biden. President Zelensky was said to have replied: 'I need ammunition, not a ride.' It was a line worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster.

            As the world stands horrified at the spiralling humanitarian crisis engulfing Ukraine, The Mail on Sunday today launches an appeal to help those most in need. Harrowing images of mothers and children wrenched from their menfolk and forced to scatter to neighbouring countries have touched Britain's heart. More than 120,000 Ukrainians have already fled across borders. In all, some four million may be forced from their homes by the conflict, potentially the worst refugee crisis in Europe since the collapse of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Our plea is simple: send us your donations and we will ensure that they reach the reputable charities best placed to help stricken families. The launch of our appeal - run in parallel with our sister paper the Daily Mail - came amid fears that a rattled President Vladimir Putin is on the verge of unleashing terrifying new weapons after his invasion stalled.

Kate then asked George to tell the group about how he has started playing rugby at his school: 'He has all the kit,' she said.

It is the latest in a string of questions being asked about the Russian leader's state of mind after he announced the invasion of Ukraine in 'rambling, terrifying, apocalyptic' fashion. Rumours surrounding the Russian leader's health have been swirling for years, with repeated reports suggesting that he is suffering from cancer and Parkinson's disease, or been affected by long Covid-19 causing 'brain fog'. Fears were raised again yesterday after US Senator Marco Rubio appeared to suggest he believes Putin is mentally unwell in a tweet that warned it was 'pretty obvious' that 'something is off' with the Russian president amid his invasion of Ukraine. 'I wish I could share more, but for now I can say it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin', the Republican Senator for Florida wrote.

            He is best known in Britain for being the secretive Chelsea owner who would while away the hours cheering on his superstars at Stamford Bridge. But Roman Abramovich, who last night ceded 'stewardship' of the top-flight team to the club's charitable foundation, has a chequed history as an oligarch and alleged crony of Vladimir Putin. The billionaire has been involved in scandals throughout the last 20 years, including allegations of blackmail, bribery and loan fraud. He has also been questioned over his links to the Russian president, with him last year denying in court he was Putin's 'cashier' in the West. Until recently he had mostly lived his hugely privileged life in peace, either onboard his superyachts, in his mansions or on one of the private jets that make up his £8.4billion empire. He has also found time to create a large family, including seven children - Ilya, Arina, Sofia, Arkadiy, Anna, Aaron and Leah - from two of his three stunning ex-wives. But that is all under threat after Putin invaded Ukraine, which swiftly brought calls for Abramovich to face sanctions and have his beloved west London football team stripped from him. Last night the tycoon released a cryptic statement handing over Chelsea FC to the trustees of the club's charitable foundation. He gave them 'stewardship' of the side but it is understood he still retains control.
