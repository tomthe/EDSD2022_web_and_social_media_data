Main outcome measures Reduction in life expectancy was estimated as the difference between observed and expected life expectancy in 2020 using the Lee-Carter model. Excess years of life lost were estimated as the difference between the observed and expected years of life lost in 2020 using the World Health Organization standard life table.

In 2021, life expectancy trends globally diverged more due to the unequal impact of the pandemic across countries, variation in the age-patterns of mortality, and differences in vaccination. We estimate life expectancy changes in 29 countries since 2020, attribute them to mortality changes by age group, and compare them to historic life expectancy shocks. Data Total death counts by age and sex came from the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations and Human Mortality databases. Registered COVID-19 deaths and vaccination counts by age and sex were sourced from the COVerAGE-DB database. Midyear population counts were extracted from the UN World Population Prospects database. Methods Life expectancy for females, males, and the total population were calculated for 29 countries for 2020 and 2021.
