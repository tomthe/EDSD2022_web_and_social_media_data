# Digital Demography: Analyzing Web and Social Media Data

Course materials for the EDSD course on digital demography.


## Preparation

We will use some APIs that require an account and an access-token. It would be useful if you create an account with Facebook and OpenAI before the course


## Content and remarks

x7 Twitter - This part will be skipped, since twitter faded into X and X has no useful API anymore. I left the content here in case anyone might be interested in it.
