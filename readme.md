# Digital Demography: Analyzing Web and Social Media Data

Course materials for the EDSD course on digital demography.


## Preparation

We will use some APIs that require an account and an access-token. 
It would be good if you create an account with Facebook and OpenAI before the course on Tuesday (But it is not strictly necessary).


## Content and remarks

x7 Twitter - This part will be skipped, since twitter faded into X and X has no useful API anymore.
I left the content here in case anyone is interested in it.
