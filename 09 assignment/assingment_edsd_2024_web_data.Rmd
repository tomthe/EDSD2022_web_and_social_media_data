Please answer the questions inside this document. Write your answers into the
code blocks which are marked by three backticks ```. Some question(s) require you
to create a file.

When you are done, put:

 * this file
 * the compiled (knitted) RMarkdown-document
 * all created file(s)

into one zip file. Name that zip "Firstname_Lastname.zip" and send it to my email:

Deadline: Wednesday (June 26, 2024) 5pm


#### Please write the HTML-code for a small Webpage.
Include a headline and a paragraph and again a headline and a paragraph.
Use CSS to change the color of the headlines to yellow.

#### Scrape the roles of the whole staff of the MPIDR

Scrape this page https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/about_us_6113/staff_directory_1899/ with R and `rvest`.
We are not interested in the names, but only in the job titles of the people. Collect all the 
job titles ("Guest Researcher", "Research Scientist",...). Count them and print out the total number 
and the numbers disaggregated by distinct job title.

```{R}

```


#### What is an API? Please explain in 2 or 3 sentences

```

```

#### Use R and and two APIs to fetch a joke and let ChatGPT explain the joke.

1. Use R to fetch a joke from an API (you can alternatively use a different API to fetch some sentence(s))
2. Extract that joke from the response and print it to the console
3. Send the joke to the ChatGPT API and ask for an explanation.
4. Print the explanation to the console

You can find a new OpenAI API-key in the file 'openAI-key.txt'

Alternatively: Use a different API than the joke API and fetch something of similar importance.

```{R}

```


#### Download data about the number of migrants in every EU country.

Total numbers and as a share of total population.
Long or tidy format. You can use the WDI package.
Get data for the last 20 years and save it as a csv-file (you can use 
the `write.csv( )` function)
Show the code and the first few rows of the data.frame. (head(df) prints the
first 5 rows of df).

```{R}

```


#### Plot the share of Migrants in a few selected countries from 2002 to now.

You can choose the countries yourself. 

```{R}

```



#### Use Wikidata to create and download a list of all Universities worldwide.

This would be an appropriate identifier: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3918 

Create a table with columns for the name of the universities, the wikidata-id.
It would be great to have optionally more columns with information about every 
university (gps-coordinates? Twitter-handles? Be creative, if you want).

Save the data as csv-file, please. You can use the query service https://query.wikidata.org/
It is not easy to get the extra-columns with the information you want, but with the help of
the examples you can find out how to to this.

Save the result as a csv file and copy the SparQL code here into this file:
```{SPARQL}

```


#### Freedom of Information Request

Describe the steps necessary to file a successful Freedom of Information Request 
in your country of citizenship. (around 250 to 600 words, please).
