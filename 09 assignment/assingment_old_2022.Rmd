## Assingment

Please answer the questions inside this document. Write your answers into the
code blocks which are marked by three backticks ```. Some question(s) require you
to create a file.

When you are done, put:

 * this file
 * the compiled (knitted) RMarkdown-document
 * all created file(s)

into one zip file. Name that zip "Firstname_Lastname.zip" and send it to my email:
theile@demogr.mpg.de 



#### Please write the HTML-code for a small Webpage.
Include a headline, a paragraph with text and a link to the edsd course website.

```

```

#### Scrape the names of all courses from the website of the edsd (https://eaps.nl/edsd/courses) with R and `rvest`
Save the list of names to a variable named `courses` and print out the names

```{R}

```


#### What is an API? Please explain in 2 or 3 sentences

```

```

#### Use R and an API to fetch a joke and print the joke.

Alternatively: Use a different API and fetch something of similar importance.

```{R}

```


#### Twitter: When did @MPIDRnews create the account?
Check here for help: https://rdrr.io/cran/academictwitteR/man/get_user_profile.html

```{R}

```

#### Twitter: Compare 3 languages: tweet-counts for the #migrant topic 

 * between 2022-09-01 to 2022-11-30
Plot the counts of tweets for every day. 3 lines for the 3 languages.

```{R}

```

#### Twitter: Download tweets

Download 100 old tweets from a city of your choice (Where you grew up?).
The tweets should be from somewhere between 2010 to 2015.

Describe the content in two, three sentences. You do not need to include
the tweets themselves. I mainly want to see the code.

```{R}

```

#### Download data about the number of migrants in every EU country.

Total numbers and as a share of total population.
Long or tidy format.
Use one of the resources/packages from the course.
Get data for the last 20 years and save it as a csv-file (you can use 
the `write.csv( )` function)
Show the code and the first few rows of the data.frame. (head(df) prints the
first 5 rows of df).

```{R}

```


#### Plot the share of Migrants in a few selected countries from 2002 to now.

You can choose the countries yourself.

```{R}

```




#### Use Wikidata to create and download a list of all Universities worldwide.

This would be an appropriate identifier: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3918 

Create a table with columns for the name of the universities, the wikidata-id.
It would be great to have optionally more columns with information about every 
university (gps-coordinates? Twitter-channels? Be creative, if you want).

Save the data as csv-file, please.
```
