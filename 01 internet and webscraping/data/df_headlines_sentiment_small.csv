But professional photographer and cinematographer Martin Gregus, 26, managed the amazing feat over the summer. He took photos of the polar bears at their most relaxed, cuddling, chilling and napping in Canada's spectacular fireweed fields close to Churchill, Manitoba, in incredible images that took 33 days to capture and have reemerged online. In one image, a mother and cub are seen in a purple field of flowers, cuddled up together (top right) and in another shot, a polar bear sleeps on a rock, curled up (bottom right).�Other images show polar bears basking in the sun and relaxing in the field (top left and inset) and feeding (bottom left). Polar bears can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and measure in excess of seven feet long and the animals are�not actually white- they have black skin with white fur.","/news/article-11457499/Polar-bears-cubs-captured-relaxed-cuddle-chill-nap.html",2022-11-23 00:15:07.908943,"dailymail",2.55
